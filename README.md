# Gemma_Local_Chat_Assistant
A fully local AI chat assistant powered by Google’s Gemma model, built and executed entirely on Google Colab — no paid API keys or cloud GPUs required!

This project uses:
🧠 Gemma 2B Instruct (GGUF) for natural conversation
🐍 llama-cpp-python for local inference
🎨 Gradio for an interactive chat interface
🌐 Hugging Face Hub for model authentication and downloading

🚀 Features
💬 Interactive chat interface (Gradio-based)
⚙️ 100% local inference — no API costs
🔐 Secure authentication via Hugging Face token
🧩 Lightweight setup compatible with free Colab GPUs
🕒 Runs slower than cloud-hosted LLMs, but fully free and private

🧱 Tech Stack
| Component            | Purpose                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Python**           | Core programming language |
| **Gradio**           | Chat interface            |
| **llama-cpp-python** | Model loading & inference |
| **Hugging Face Hub** | Model access & management |
| **Google Colab**     | Free runtime environment  |

🧠 Notes
⚠️ The model may respond slowly since it runs on free Colab resources, but this project demonstrates 
how to use open-source AI locally without relying on paid APIs — perfect for experimentation and learning!
